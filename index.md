## Calculator

![Calculator](https://github.com/funpopSDM/2018-2019_Programming_Portfolio/blob/master/Projects/Calculator/Calc01.png?raw=true)
#### Description:
This is a simple calculator with all of the basic operators and the additional sin, cos, and tan operators.

Note: This calculator is in radians mode. This is simply because Processing does not have a calculate-in-degrees mode, or at least not to my knowledge.
